# Image-Clustering-using-Gaussian-Mixture-Model
The objective of the project is to implement the probabilistic clustering model-Gaussian Mixture Model which is based on expectation maximization algorithm and using it for satellite image clustering. The model uses Gaussian mixture models to model the original image, and transforms segmentation problem into the maximum likelihood parameter estimation by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and use it to classify the pixels of the image, This segmentation can be useful for recognizing of objects, detecting of edges etc. by the machine.
